# Oracle Pool Hub

An oracle pool launching platform for Ergo.

## Introduction

Oracle Pools (OP) have sparked a lot of interest and excitement, rightly so. However, being a relatively new development, the oracle pool ecosystem remains a bit rough around the edges. As decentralised applications flourish on the Ergo network, more pools will be needed - as well as reliable oracle operators. In order to facilitate the adoption of OP technology, this project aims to address the following pain points:

- Individuals wanting to contribute resources, as oracle operators, often don't know where to start.
- Similarly, dapp developers have many things to think about, intricacies of launching an oracle pool shouldn't be one of them.
- Pools rely on decentralised oracles, but there is currently no system in place to facilitate token distribution. For instance, the current ERG/USD pool had its tokens distributed to community members that happened to be around at launch. Perfectly fine for the early days but hard to scale while guaranteeing recruitment of good actors.
- Some early oracle operators have been disappointed by the returns and shut down their cores. This is partly due to V1 pools being suboptimal, but could also be alleviated by upfront info and stats informing aspiring operators what to expect in terms of rewards and expenses.
- Once a pool has recruited it’s oracles, they can’t be changed. It is therefore crucial to know which ones are reliable. There is no system in place to facilitate this.
- In the future, with more pools running, oracle users will first look for existing pools to rely on instead of spinning their own. There is currently no standard to capture how pools were created or how their oracles were selected. Something a pool user (dapp developers and users) would want to verify.
- Some features worked out at the protocol level remain to be implemented in the off-chain tooling. Stake slashing is a good example.

## Team

The team gathered around a post in the `#i-need-a-team` channel on the Ergo Discord and includes the following members, in alphabetical order:

- abchris: `todo - A brief explanation of the skillsets of each team member and why they are important to the proposal.`
- Balb: `todo - A brief explanation of the skillsets of each team member and why they are important to the proposal.`
- curbsideprophet: `todo - A brief explanation of the skillsets of each team member and why they are important to the proposal.`
- error: `todo - A brief explanation of the skillsets of each team member and why they are important to the proposal.`

Community developer Luivatra, busy as he is, expressed interest and offered support.

## ErgoHack Theme

The theme of ErgoHack III is privacy and security. The latter is often associated with protocol improvements or infrastructure hardening. The Oracle Pool Hub will contribute to security, at a somewhat higher level, by:

- Facilitating decentralisation of oracle operators: `todo - explain how`
- Making it easier to "background check" oracle pools and oracle operators: `todo - explain how`
- Empowering the broader community (KYA): Oracles, and oracle pools by extensions, are an integral part of DeFi. In the spirit of Ergo's KYA (know your assumptions), there is a need to educate the broader community on how pools operate and what to look for when using products relying on oracles. The platform would be a perfect place to disseminate such information.
