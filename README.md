# Oracle Pool Hub*
*or wathever we end up naming this...

## TL;DR
Oracle Pool launching platform for Ergo, to match oracle operators with pool creators whilst enhancing security through transparency and documentation.

## Motivation
Oracle Pools have sparked a lot of interest and excitement, rightly so. However, being a relatively new development, the oracle pool ecosystem remains a bit rough around the edges. As dApps flourish on the Ergo network, more pools will be needed - as well as reliable oracle operators. In order to facilitate this process, this project aims to address the following pain points:

- People wanting to contribute resources, as oracle operators, often don't know where to start.
- Similarly, dApp devs have many things to think about, launching an oracle pool shouldn't be one of them.
- Pools rely on decentralised oracles, but there is currently no system in place to facilitate token distribution. For instance, the current ERG/USD pool had its tokens distributed to community members that happened to be around at launch, perfectly fine in the early days but hard to scale while guaranteeing recruitment of good actors.
- Some early oracle operators have been disappointed by the returns and shut down their cores. This is partly due to V1 pools being suboptimal, but could also be alleviated by upfront info and stats informing aspiring operators what to expect.
- Once a pool has recruited it’s oracles, they can’t be changed. It is therefore crucial to know which ones are reliable. There is no system in place to facilitate this.
- In the future, with more pools running, oracle users will first look for existing pools to rely on instead of spinning their own. There is currently no standard to capture how pools were created or how their oracles were selected. Something a pool user (dApp devs and users) would want to verify.
- Some features worked out at the protocol level remain to be implemented. Stake slashing is the best example.

### Co-benefits
Oracles, and oracle pools by extensions, are an integral part of DeFi. In the spirit of Ergo's KYA (know your assumptions), there is a need to educate the broader community on how pools operate and what to look for when using products relying on oracles.
This platform would be a perfect place to disseminate such information.

## Rough roadmap
In time, this project aims to achieve the following:
1. Lowering the technical threshold to onboard oracle operators by providing scripts and or installers.
2. Providing a web based interface to configure and launch new pools.
3. Maintaining a register of (aspiring) operators to facilitate matching with pool creators.
4. Tracking reliability of oracle operators through enhanced on-chain monitoring and optional verification levels.
6. Build documentation and infographics to educate and raise awareness
7. Promoting further development of the tech stack (https://github.com/ergoplatform/oracle-core)

## Links to security (ErgoHack III)
The third Ergo hackathon's theme is privacy and security. This effort would contribute to security at a somewhat higher level by:
- facilitating decentralisation of oracle operators
- making it easier to "background check" oracle pools and oracle operators
- empowering the broader community (KYA)

## Contributing
Looking for hands with skills in any of these:
- DevOps
- Frontend
- Backend
- Rust
- Graphic design (logos, infographics)

Anyone is welcome to join the effort. If you feel like you can contribute in some way or the other, or want to share ideas, get in touch!
